# Daycare-Report-Card-System
The Daycare Report Card System is an application for recording the behavior of students at a local daycare center. Teachers can make grades for students throughout the day noting if they have been behaving well or not. Guardians can login to view their children's grades. Grades and students can be deleted by teachers.
